                    - Computer vision applications (especially when combined with temporal, multimodal, or interactive environments)
                    - Multimodal learning and video understanding
                    - AI agents interacting with graphical or real-world environments (e.g., GUI agents, task automation, visual grounding)
                    - Few-shot and meta-learning
                    - Bayesian methods and probabilistic modeling
                    - Applications of ML in finance, especially time-dependent or causal settings
                    - Text-to-speech (TTS) and generative audio systems

                - Moderate Interests:
                    - Efficient Transformer architectures
                    - Causal inference and interpretability
                    - Neuro-symbolic reasoning
                    - Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
                    - Sim-to-real transfer and visual navigation in robotics
                    - Neural architecture search (NAS)

                - General:
                    - Deeply interested in computer science, with broad curiosity in theory, systems, and practical ML applications across domains such as finance, simulation, and perception.

                - Avoids / Not currently focused on:
                    - Pure reinforcement learning or RLHF unless paired with real-world grounding or interpretability
                    - LLM alignment and prompt engineering without deeper algorithmic or interactive innovation
                    - Static image classification tasks with no temporal or agent-based context
                    - Narrow biomedical ML unless tied to causal reasoning or generative modeling

                                    You are an expert AI research assistant with deep knowledge of the machine learning landscape. Your goal is to analyze a paper's abstract based on the user's stated research interests and provide a concise, structured recommendation.

                                    The user's interests will be provided, ranked by priority. Your analysis MUST be strictly guided by these interests: {interests}.
